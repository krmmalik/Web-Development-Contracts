#The Process
We have a defined process for the delivery of digital projects.

### Scope
Each project has a "scope" that is defined by the client.
This is a simple mission statement, or an **objective** that defines the end product as part of the project deliverable. 

This is so that all persons working on the project have enough context to to deliver the project to satisfaction.

Any changes in scope must be re-quoted for, and once work starts on a project, the scope changes will not be accepted until the project delivery has been completed.


### Project Brief
After the initial meeting with the client, the client's requirements are turned into a project brief for the client to review.

Once the client has confirmed the project brief, this is passed to the developer to be converted into a **functional specification** or **statement of work**

Any changes to the project brief must be re-quoted for, both for estimates and final quotes. Once the project begins, project brief changes cannot be accepted.

All stages of the project must be 'signed-off' by your designated Project Manager.


### Functional specification
Initially clients are provided with a ball-park figure of the cost of the project. Due to the nature of development, a more accurate final quote can only be provided once a functional specification or a statement of work has been created.

Clients will have the opportunity to liaise directly with the developer to provide input in order to develop the statement of work or functional specification. 

This part of the process is chargeable.

### Design First
Where possible, we always aim to address the design stages of the project before actual development work begins. Our freelancers use varying methods during the design stages, and upon project commencement, you will be notified about the method likely to be used to begin the design process.


### Creative Control and Options
Clients are given two options regards creative control.

1. **Project Manager Control** All design decisions are made by KRM Ventures and supporting team, with *only* feedback pertaining to **quality** of work delivered provided by the client. 
Client's are welcome to provide a brief on "values" and color palette, but final subjective design decisions rest with the designated project manager.
Minor changes to design that do not affect structural design and coding elements will be entertained for up to a maximum of two revisions.

2. **Client Control** Clients make final design decisions and and are given a fixed number of change requests as part of the design work. Design quality and overall "look" responsibility rests with the client and not KRM ventures. 

Additional change requests outside of the scope are chargeable for.
All minor changes to design are accepted for the quoted number of change requests. Additional revisions are chargeable.

Minor changes pertain to cosmetic changes that involve colour, images used, font sizes, content and some basic elements of user interface functionality. Anything outside of this scope is considered a major change request.

Your project manager will advise you at each stage whether your change request is considered minor or major.

Major design changes that may affect or require major coding or development work, or that require structural changes, must be quoted for additionally. These cannot be entertained as part of the change requests and revisions.


### Themes
For our standard projects, we offer pre-made designs either sourced from Theme Marketplaces or from our list of designers. These are pre-made skeletons/templates that we integrate into the project. Clients are welcome to choose their own theme if taking responsibility for 'creative control' or we can choose a theme on their behalf. 

Themes help keep costs to a minimum and give a good indication of a approximately what the end result will look like.


### CMS
For some of our projects we offer CMS based solutions. CMS stands for Content Management System. This allows the clients to update their website content without having to refer work back to a developer. For clients receiving CMS based solutions, clients are expected to take responsibility for adding, maintaining and updating their own content.

We normally offer a 45 minute training session for the CMS after final project delivery.



### Project Delivery
Once the functional specification or the statement of work has been created. The client will be provided with delivery times.

Our freelancers work on multiple projects at once, and have varying schedules. Therefore our timescales may not match industry standard delivery times. However, if your project delivery requirements are urgent, we can provide you with a quote for speedier delivery. Please ask us further about this.

During project development, you may be contacted by the freelancer(s)working on your project. We request our clients to be as helpful to our freelancers as possible, but to be mindful of distracting them with information that may be outside the scope of the project.
