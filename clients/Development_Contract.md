#The Process
We have a defined process for the delivery of digital projects.

    ##Scope
    Each project has a "scope" that is defined by the client. 

    This is so that all persons working on the project have enough context to to deliver the project to satisfaction.

    Any changes in scope must be re-quoted for, and once work starts on a project, the scope changes will not be accepted until the project delivery has been completed.

    ## Functional specification
    Initially clients are provided with a ball-park figure of the cost of the project. Due to the nature of development, a more accurate final quote can only be provided once a functional specification or a statement of work has been created.

    Clients will have the opportunity to liaise directly with the developer to provide input in order to develop the statement of work or functional specification. 

    This part of the process is chargeable.
