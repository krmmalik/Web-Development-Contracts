Freelancer expectations
========================

Our reputation depends on the quality of work delivered by our freelancers. Our personalised approach to our clients is what results in referrals, therefore we choose to only work with the freelancers that are able to deliver and understand the expectations below.

If there is only *one* thing you remember from this document, let it be this:

**Honour your commitments**

#Client Communication
Communicating directly with the client is welcome, and encouraged.
We request you to keep the communication to the scope of your role within the project.

# Project Delivery
All delivery times that are set by you **must** be met.
All deliverables agreed as part of the project **must** be delivered.

# Project Development
Our freelancers are encouraged to built atop existing solutions where conducive to the project. Leveraging existing codebases, APIs, structures and open source projects results in faster delivery, lower cost, efficient development and a level of reliability since existing solutions have solved most of the problems that we may face. Avoid "re-inventing the wheel" as much as possible.

#Excellence
We have a commitment to customer excellence and satisfaction to our clients and hope that you will support us in our commitment to them.

#Project Management
We currently use BitBucket for most of our project management. We hope that you'll agree to using our project management tools and methods of choice and have the appropriate organisational skills to help us keep the project running smoothly.

We are open to suggestions for improvements and encourage new ideas.


Contractual Information
=======================
We normally offer our clients 1 or 2 change requests for the work, and prefer a design-first approach to development, where scope, project brief and design are agreed, reviewing and "locked-down" before actual development begins.

For all projects, please understand that change requests/revisions will need to be entertained, so please factor time for this into your quotes.
