Freelancer expectations
========================

Our reputation depends on the quality of work delivered by our freelancers. Our personalised approach to our clients is what results in referrals, therefore we choose to only work with the freelancers that are able to deliver and understand the expectations below.

#Client Communication
Communicating directly with the client is welcome, and encouraged.
We request you to keep the communication to the scope of your role within the project.

# Project Delivery
All delivery times that are set by you **must** be met.
All deliverables agreed as part of the project **must** be delivered.

#Excellence
We have a commitment to customer excellence and satisfaction to our clients and hope that you will support us in our commitment to them.

#Project Management
We currently use BitBucket for most of our project management. We hope that you'll agree to using our project management tools and methods of choice and have the appropriate organisational skills to help us keep the project running smoothly.
