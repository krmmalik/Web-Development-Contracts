Our Network of Freelancers
==========================

KRM Ventures is primarily a Digital Consultancy, however in supporting businesses with their sales and operations, there are often requirements for specialist work. For this reason, KRM Ventures maintains an active network of freelancers around the world.

#Who we work with
We work with all types of freelancers that are able to provide some form of Digital or Sales/Operations expertise. This ranges from Developers and Designers, through to PPC and SEO specialists, as well as Sales, Marketing and business experts.

#What we love
First and foremost our emphasis is on personality. We choose freelancers with a great personality and a healthy attitude towards their work, over those with 'big name' backgrounds and an impressive skill-set. We seek to develop long-term relationships with those that support our work for our clients.

We love working with individuals that enjoy self-study, that are current with trends, dabble in their own side-projects and have a naturally curious disposition.
